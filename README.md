# Calculator using OOP PHP
 This is a simple object-oriented programming calculator. I felt it was an essencial exercise to test my own skills. 
### In these coding I could develop the following skills:
    * Object-Oriented Programming (class and object);
    * Switch Statements;
    * Local and Global scopes;
    * Error Handlers;
    * PHP Function (number_format());
    * 4 arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /);
